# About Me
Hi, I'm **Yassine OFQIR-HAMMA** from Morocco, born in 1998. I studied renewable energy at university, but later decided to switch my career to web development. You can learn more about [my dev journey](/en/#dev-journey-section) and why I made this decision.

Currently, I've been working as a solar engineer for 2 years, but I'm actively seeking new opportunities in web development. As you'll see in my projects section, I focus on building projects relevant to *solar energy* so that I can apply real use cases, avoiding generic and repetitive work.

I'm passionate about tech, both hardware and software, but I also enjoy other interests like reading *Arabic literature* and playing video games.
