Typically, I wouldnâ€™t regard tutorial videos as a **showcase**. However, this tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg" target="_blank">Theo</a>, the creator of <a href="https://create.t3.gg/" target="_blank">T3-Stack</a>, effectively demonstrates the new abilities of *React Server Components* and the new *Next.js app directory*, showcasing a tech and services stack that scales efficiently in a production environment.
