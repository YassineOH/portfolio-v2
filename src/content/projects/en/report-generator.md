As a solar engineer, I've encountered the tedious chore of downloading and formatting monthly reports for our customers. To simplify this process, I embarked on creating an appâ€”a minimalist platform designed for monitoring our solar plants equipped with only *Huawei inverters* (at least for now). 
This tool not only streamlines report generation, including vital data like solar production and monthly savings but also oversees installation performance, bypassing the complexities of FusionSolar's interface.
The app operates under the MIT license and serves as an open-source solution.
*If you don't have a solar plant with a Huawei Inverter, you can either visit the public repo or browse the screenshots in the link below.*
